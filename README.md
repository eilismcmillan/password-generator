This website generates a random password based on user selections. When the 'generate button' is pressed, a prompt window appears prompting user to enter a numerical value in response to the question "Length of password?". If the user selects a number not within 8-128 characters, an alert pops up to notify the user that input must be within these paramaters. Likewise, if a non-numerical answer is given, an alert also pops up.

If password length input is within the available range, following prompts pop up: "Do you want the password to include lowercase characters?", "Do you want the password to include uppercase characters?", "Do you want the password to include numerical characters?", and "Do you want the password to include special characters?". Pressing 'cancel' simulates a no response; Pressing 'OK' simulates a yes response. Users must select at least one character type or an alert pops up. 

Once all the prompts have been answered, a password is generated. The length of which is the user inputed length, and includes only the characters selected by the user. The generated password is outputed text box on screen. To generate a new password, users must click the the 'generate password' button again, and the prompts begin again.
